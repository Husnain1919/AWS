Structured Data:

Definition: Structured data refers to information that is organized in a highly predictable and well-defined manner. It follows a fixed data model with a clear schema, resembling a traditional relational database.
Example: SQL databases, such as Amazon RDS, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and data types. Each entry adheres to a structured schema.
Semi-Structured Data:

Definition: Semi-structured data is less rigid than structured data and does not conform to a fixed schema. It incorporates some level of flexibility and may include tags or markers for organization.
Examples:
XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Uses tags to structure data hierarchically.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): Represents data as key-value pairs, offering flexibility.
CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Represents tabular data but lacks a formal schema, making it semi-structured.

Unstructured Data:

Definition: Unstructured data lacks a predefined data model or structure. It is typically text-heavy and doesn't fit neatly into a database table. This category includes diverse and free-form content.
Examples:
Text Documents: Books, articles, and other textual content without a specific schema.
Multimedia Files: Audio, video, and images that don't have inherent structural organization.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Content: Text data that may not have a clear structure but is analyzed for insights
